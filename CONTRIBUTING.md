Thank you for considering contributing to our project! We welcome contributions, whether it's through bug fixes, new features, documentation improvements, or other suggestions. To help you get started, we've created this guide for contributing.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues
If you've encountered a bug or have a question about the project, please check the existing issues to see if it has already been reported. If not, open a new issue, and be sure to provide as much detail as possible, including:
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Any relevant screenshots or error messages

### Suggesting Enhancements
If you have an idea for a new feature or improvement, please open an issue and describe the enhancement in detail. Be sure to explain why it's beneficial to the project.

### Pull Requests (PRs)
We accept contributions in the form of pull requests. Here's how you can submit one:
1. **Fork the repository** to your own GitHub account.
2. **Clone your fork** to your local machine.
3. **Create a new branch** for your changes (`git checkout -b my-feature-branch`).
4. Make your changes and **commit** them with a meaningful message (`git commit -m "Add new feature"`).
5. **Push** your changes to your fork (`git push origin my-feature-branch`).
6. **Create a pull request** from your branch to the `main` branch of the original repository.

### Code Style
- Follow the existing code style in the project (indentation, variable names, etc.).
- Ensure that your code passes the project's tests before submitting a PR.

### Tests
If you're adding a new feature or fixing a bug, make sure to add relevant tests. You can run the existing tests by using [pytest](https://pytest.org/) (or any other testing framework the project uses).
