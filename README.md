## Intended Usage
BME-X is designed for researchers and clinicians working with structural MRIs to enhance image quality and perform standardized analyses.

### Method
In structural magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, motion artifacts, low resolution, imaging noise, and variability in acquisition protocols, frequently degrade image quality and confound downstream analyses. Here we report a flexible and easy-to-implement Brain MRI Enhancement foundation (BME-X) model for the motion correction, resolution enhancement, denoising and harmonization of MR images. Our framework also exhibits the capability to estimate high-field-like (7T-like) images from 3T images, handle pathological brain MRIs with multiple sclerosis or gliomas, harmonize MRIs acquired by various scanners, and can be easily extended for "end-to-end" neuroimaging analyses, such as tissue segmentation.

</div>   
In the first column, from top to bottom are T1w images with severe, moderate and minor artifacts, and two low resolution images (1.0×1.0×3.0 mm<sup>3</sup>). The corresponding enhanced images generated by different methods are shown from the second column to the last column. The resolution of the 2D sagittal and coronal slices (the corrupted images in the last two rows) is indicated in bold as 1.0×1.0×3.0 mm<sup>3</sup> and 1.0×1.0×3.0 mm<sup>3</sup>, respectively. The corresponding enhanced results are in a resolution of 0.8×0.8×0.8 mm<sup>3</sup>.

Enhancement results and the bias quantification for 280 _in vivo_ corrupted T1w images from the [MR-ART dataset](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004173/versions/1.0.2), generated by competing methods and the BME-X model. a, Visual comparison of the enhanced results. The first and the seventh columns show _in vivo_ corrupted images with two levels of real artifacts (i.e., HM1 and HM2) acquired from the same participant. The remaining columns show the enhanced results generated by four competing methods and the BME-X model. b, Quantitative comparison on 280 _in vivo_ corrupted images using tissue volumes (i.e., WM, GM, CSF, ventricle, and hippocampus), mean cortical thickness, as well as the corresponding difference compared with STAND. In each box plot, the midline represents the median value, and its lower and upper edges represent the first and third quartiles. The whiskers go down to the smallest value and up to the largest. The dotted line represents the mean value or a zero value.

## Training Steps

   In folder: ***Training_files***
   1. Download an example training dataset (in HDF5 format) from https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/8jrphll6vu4sbw56x9ni7/h?rlkey=nfspdxoyr0u61i1xh29dauohu&dl=0. More information about HDF5 format is avaliable at <https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/hdf5-files.html>.
   2. Train a caffe model:

    # For a local installation of Caffe
    caffe train -solver solver.prototxt -gpu 0 >train.log 2>&1 &
    
    # For a Docker-based installation of Caffe
    dcaffe train -solver solver.prototxt -gpu 0 >train.log 2>&1 & 

- ***solver.prototxt***: This file defines the training configurations for your model, including:

  - The base learning rate (base_lr: 0.005).
  - The network definition file (net: "train.prototxt").
  - The step size for learning rate adjustments (stepsize: 222). Adjust this parameter based on the number of training samples..
  - The saving path for model snapshots (snapshot_prefix: "./").
  - Other training-related parameters.

- ***-gpu***: Specifies the GPU ID to use for training.

- ***train.log***: A log file that records details of the model's training process.

- ***train.prototxt***: Defines the network architecture.

- ***train_dataset.txt***: Contains the file names of the training dataset.
  
- ***test_dataset.txt***: Contains the file names of the testing dataset.

The network architecture is based on the **Anatomy-Guided Densely-Connected U-Net (ADU-Net)**, as described in the paper:
L. Wang, G. Li, F. Shi, X. Cao, C. Lian, D. Nie, et al., "Volume-based analysis of 6-month-old infant brain MRI for autism biomarker identification and early diagnosis," MICCAI, 2018, pp. 411-419. [Paper](https://liwang.web.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/11006/2018/10/Volume-Based-Analysis-Of-6-Month-Old.pdf) [Code](https://liwang.web.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/11006/2020/04/Anatomy_Guided_Densely_Connected_U_Net.txt)

### PyTorch network architecture

   In the folder ***PyTorch_version***, we implemented the same network architecture using PyTorch. The implementation can be found in _Enhancement_model_.py.

## Testing Steps
   
### Folder descriptions
   ***Pretrained_models***: Contains eight pretrained models used for testing images at different ages.
   
   ***Templates***: Includes eight corresponding image templates for histogram matching.
   
   ***Testing_subjects***: A testing sample at 24 months (_test_img.???_). The corresponding reconstruction result (_test_img-recon.nii.gz_).

### How to test
   
   1. Perform histogram matching for testing images using the provided templates (located in the folder ***Templates***):
    
   2. Run the test:
      
    # For a local installation of Caffe:
    python2 Reconstruction_test.py   

    # For a Docker-based installation of Caffe:
    dpython Reconstruction_test_docker.py 

Please select the corresponding models and reference files based on your requirements:
   -  Pretrained model setup: "mynet = caffe.Net(protopath+'deploy.prototxt',protopath+'reconstruction_24m_T1.caffemodel',caffe.TEST)", where 'reconstruction_24m_T1.caffemodel' is the pretrained model file containing the learned weights for the network.
   -  Path to the test images: "datapath='Testing_subjects/'"
   -  Reference file for histogram matching: "reference_name = sitk.ReadImage('Templates/Template_T1_24.hdr')"
    
## System requirements

Ubuntu 20.04.1
    
Caffe version 1.0.0-rc3

We provide two options for installing the Caffe framework on your local PC.  
    
### 1. Docker-based installation of Caffe

Note: The Caffe framework is included in a Docker image for your convenience.

For instructions on Docker and Nvidia-Docker installation, please visit:
https://github.com/iBEAT-V2/iBEAT-V2.0-Docker#run-the-pipeline

#### a. Download the image

Please download the image from the following link: [https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/jgszaaldp97fktmi833je/caffe.tar?rlkey=snaxky2fz9ljn8a8mt0jz7d5q&dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/ulx9a6ytdw2hpeoaahlxt/caffe.tar?rlkey=y6zwg5etyzhbtmw2l2i5rbjk2&dl=0). (The image is _caffe.tar_)

#### b. Load the image into your local PC. 

To load the Docker image, use the following command:

    docker load < caffe.tar 
    
You can verify that the image was loaded successfully by running:

    docker images

#### c. Add an alias to your _~/.bashrc_ file. 

To easily access Caffe from the Docker image, add the following aliases to your ~/.bashrc file: 

    alias dcaffe='nvidia-docker run --rm -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -v $(pwd):$(pwd) -w $(pwd) caffe:v2 /usr/local/caffe/caffe_rc3/build/tools/caffe'
    alias dpython='nvidia-docker run --rm -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -v $(pwd):$(pwd) -w $(pwd) caffe:v2 python'

Then, refresh your shell by running:

    source ~/.bashrc

#### d. Test Caffe  

To test if Caffe is working properly, run:

    dcaffe

The screen will show:  
    
<img src="https://github.com/YueSun814/Img-folder/blob/main/caffe_display.jpg" width="50%">    

    dpython

No output will be displayed. 

### 2. Local installation 

To make sure of consistency with our used version (e.g., including 3d convolution, and WeightedSoftmaxWithLoss, etc.), we strongly recommend installing _Caffe_ using our released ***caffe_rc3***. The installation steps are easy to perform without compilation procedure: 
    
#### a. Download ***caffe_rc3*** and ***caffe_lib***.
    
caffe_rc3: <https://github.com/YueSun814/caffe_rc3>
    
caffe_lib: <https://github.com/YueSun814/caffe_lib>
    
#### b. Add paths of _caffe_lib_, and _caffe_rc3/python_ to your _~/.bashrc_ file. For example, if the folders are saved in the home path, then add the following commands to the _~/.bashrc_ 
   
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/caffe_lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   
    export PYTHONPATH=~/caffe_rc3/python:$PATH

Then, "source ~/.bashrc".

#### c. Test Caffe 
    
     cd caffe_rc3/build/tools
    
     ./caffe
    
Then, the screen will show:  
    
<img src="https://github.com/YueSun814/Img-folder/blob/main/caffe_display.jpg" width="50%">
    
Typical install time: few minutes.
