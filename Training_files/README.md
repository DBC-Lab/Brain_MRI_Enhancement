   1. Download an example training dataset (in HDF5 format) from https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/8jrphll6vu4sbw56x9ni7/h?rlkey=nfspdxoyr0u61i1xh29dauohu&dl=0. More information about HDF5 format is avaliable at <https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/hdf5-files.html>.
   2. Train a caffe model:

    # For a local installation of Caffe
    caffe train -solver solver.prototxt -gpu 0 >train.log 2>&1 &
    
    # For a Docker-based installation of Caffe
    dcaffe train -solver solver.prototxt -gpu 0 >train.log 2>&1 & 

- ***solver.prototxt***: This file defines the training configurations for your model, including:

  - The base learning rate (base_lr: 0.005).
  - The network definition file (net: "train.prototxt").
  - The step size for learning rate adjustments (stepsize: 222). Adjust this parameter based on the number of training samples..
  - The saving path for model snapshots (snapshot_prefix: "./").
  - Other training-related parameters.

- ***-gpu***: Specifies the GPU ID to use for training.

- ***train.log***: A log file that records details of the model's training process.

- ***train.prototxt***: Defines the network architecture.

The network architecture is based on the **Anatomy-Guided Densely-Connected U-Net (ADU-Net)**, as described in the paper:
