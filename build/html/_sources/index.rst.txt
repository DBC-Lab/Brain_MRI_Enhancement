A foundation model for the motion correction, super resolution, denoising and harmonization of magnetic resonance images, can improve the performance of machine-learning models across a wide range of tasks.

Method
-------

In structural magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, motion artifacts, low resolution, imaging noise, and variability in acquisition protocols, frequently degrade image quality and confound downstream analyses. Here we report a flexible and easy-to-implement Brain MRI Enhancement foundation (BME-X) model for the motion correction, resolution enhancement, denoising and harmonization of MR images. Our framework also exhibits the capability to estimate high-field-like (7T-like) images from 3T images, handle pathological brain MRIs with multiple sclerosis or gliomas, harmonize MRIs acquired by various scanners, and can be easily extended for "end-to-end" neuroimaging analyses, such as tissue segmentation.

Enhancement results and the bias quantification for 280 in vivo corrupted T1w images from the `MR-ART <https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004173/versions/1.0.2>`_ dataset, generated by competing methods and the BME-X model. a, Visual comparison of the enhanced results. The first and the seventh columns show in vivo corrupted images with two levels of real artifacts (i.e., HM1 and HM2) acquired from the same participant. The remaining columns show the enhanced results generated by four competing methods and the BME-X model. b, Quantitative comparison on 280 in vivo corrupted images using tissue volumes (i.e., WM, GM, CSF, ventricle, and hippocampus), mean cortical thickness, as well as the corresponding difference compared with STAND. In each box plot, the midline represents the median value, and its lower and upper edges represent the first and third quartiles. The whiskers go down to the smallest value and up to the largest. The dotted line represents the mean value or a zero value.

======================
Installation & Usage
======================

We have integrated the `LifespanStrip <https://github.com/DBC-Lab/Atlases-empowered_Lifespan_Skull_Stripping>`_ framework and the `BME-X <https://github.com/DBC-Lab/Brain_MRI_Enhancement>`_ model into a single Docker image to make it more convenient for everyone to use. By inputting T1w/T2w raw images, this pipeline goes through RAI orientation, intensity inhomogeneity correction, skull stripping, and image enhancement for the brain region. Additionally, the Quality Index (QI) of the original images is provided for reference.


Download
----------

To pull the image, use the following command ::

    docker pull yuesun814/bme-x:v1.0.3
  
How to Run the Container
------------------------- 

Basic Command
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Run the Docker container using the following command ::

    docker run --gpus all -v /path/to/input:/app/data yuesun814/bme-x:v1.0.3 --bids_root filename_of_BIDS_dataset --subject_id id_of_subject --session_id id_of_session

   
``-v /path/to/input`` mounts the input data directory to the container's ``/app/data`` directory.

``--bids_root`` specifies the BIDS dataset to be processed.

``--subject_id`` specifies a subject within the BIDS dataset to be processed (optional).

``--session_id`` specifies a session within the BIDS dataset to be processed (optional).

Example Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For example, using the `test_BIDS_raw <https://github.com/DBC-Lab/Brain_MRI_Enhancement/tree/main/test_BIDS_raw>`_ we provided. The following command will process all the data that meets the criteria within the *test_BIDS_raw*. ::

    docker run --gpus all -v /home/user/data:/app/data yuesun814/bme-x:v1.0.3 --bids_root test_BIDS_raw
    
The following command will process a specific subject when the ``--subject_id`` is provided (e.g. 0001). ::
   
    docker run --gpus all -v /home/user/data:/app/data yuesun814/bme-x:v1.0.3 --bids_root test_BIDS_raw --subject_id 0001 
    
The following command will process a specific session when the ``--session_id`` (e.g. V02) is provided. ::
    
    docker run --gpus all -v /home/user/data:/app/data yuesun814/bme-x:v1.0.3 --bids_root test_BIDS_raw --session_id V02
